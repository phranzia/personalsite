                <p>It has been over a decade since I began my career in healthcare and several years since I wrote my first line of code. 
                  I have cared for the most ill patients, helped launch therapies that can treat millions and those for rare conditions, 
                  maintained a global drug and disease database essential for healthcare organizations, and have founded a healthcare 
                  education technology company. My current motivation is to leverage technology to improve human outcomes, enhance 
                  the quality of life of patients and healthcare providers, and make treatment availability less burdensome. 
                </p>  -->
                <!--Healthcare providers dedicate much of their time worrying 
                    about their patients and contemplating whether they gave 
                    them the best care. These worries followed me day after 
                    day as I treated the most complicated patients in the 
                    intensive care unit at the University of New Mexico Hospital. 
                    After five years, I shifted my focus from direct patient care 
                    to developing and maintaining healthcare tools and technologies 
                    that have a widespread impact on bettering patient care and 
                    equipping healthcare providers with the knowledge they need to 
                    make informed treatment decisions. -->
